Module 10 Challenge
Part 1: Analyze and Explore the Climate Data
I used SQLAlchemy to query data from the Hawaii.sqlite database
Based on those queries I used Pandas to plot Precipitation Analysis and Station Analysis
The code is stored in Climate.ipynb file in the SurfsUp folder
I received assisance creating the bar chart portion of the Climate.ipynb code

Part 2: Design Your Climate App
I used the queries from Part 1 to to develop a Flask API and JSON to display precipitation, station and temperature data
This code is stored in app.py file in the SurfsUp folder
I used the Xpert Learning Assistant to help debug my many, many issues with my connections to sqlite
